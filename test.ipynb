      "John Doe has a history of essential hypertension diagnosed at age 38, which has been well-controlled with medication (Amlodipine 5mg). His past myocardial infarction in 2018, for which he underwent angioplasty, indicates underlying coronary artery disease. His risk factors include a family history of cardiovascular disease and his prior cardiac event.\n",

      "**Full Diagnosis:**\n",
      "John's clinical profile suggests he is a patient with stable ischemic heart disease secondary to atherosclerosis, with well-managed hypertension and lipid levels. His history of MI and angioplasty, combined with hypertension and family history, underscore his high cardiovascular risk.\n",

      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "- Continue current antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy.\n",

      "- Regular monitoring of blood pressure, lipid profile, and cardiac status.\n",
